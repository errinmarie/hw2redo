      <h2>Belgium is...Boring</h2>
      <p>My husband and I both agree: Belgium is pretty boring. To be fair, we'd just come from Amsterdam, which had similar sights and a much cooler vibe. But after you've taken your pictures, there's not much to do in Bruges or Ghent, and the chocolate was not all that was promised.</p>
