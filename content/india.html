      <h2>India: Land of Spices</h2>
      <p>India is awesome, and remains one of the coolest places I've ever visited. I went with my brother, which was awkward, cause everyone assumed we were married and kept arranging romantic dinners and double beds for us.</p>
      <p>I ate my way through that trip. I ate like it was my J.O.B. There was just so much <em>food</em>. Curries and naans and parathas and chutneys and rice, and oh God, the picked garlic! Did you know there was such a thing?? I put it on every dish and it was <em>amazing</em>. There were days we spent more time eating than touring. After one abundant lunch (and romantic elephant ride), I nearly wept when we were presented with a multi-course candlelit dinner, and a staff of four to serve us.</p>
      <p>"I'm gonna puke," my brother whispered to me.</p>
      <p>"Whatever," I said. "Just do it quietly and come back and eat this so we don't hurt their feelings."</p>
      <p>(This original content doesn't need to be <em>good</em>, does it?)</p>
