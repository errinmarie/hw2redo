      <h2>Bhutan: Kingdom in the Clouds</h2>
      <p>I'm definitely going to get some original content on these pages, because I actually <em>have</em> been to Bhutan. I did this damn hike and everything. It took me most of the day and I was the last one to reach the top, never mind the fact that I was 30 years younger than everyone else in my group. (You ever had altitude sickness? It's no fun.)</p>
      <p>Still, while climbing the <strong><em>seven hundred</em></strong> stairs down - and then back up! - the gorge, I passed an old dude who had one foot in the grave. He was struggling with those steps, one tiny pace at a time, and he was supported on each arm by a cheerful young helper. It was clear that that guy was going to reach the top no matter how long it took - and if he died up there, maybe that was okay. It might have been preferable to repeating the seven hundred steps on the way out.</p>
      <p>I really am a better writer than this.</p>
