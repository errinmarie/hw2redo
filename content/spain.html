      <h2>The Pain in Spain</h2>
      <p>I went to Spain with my college choir. It was years ago and I don't remember much about it, but I do recall that we went to see a bullfight, and for some reason I was astonished that they actually killed the bulls. It was hard to watch. And those things go on <em>forever</em>. We sat through 3 rounds of dead bulls, then decided we'd had enough and got up to leave. And the people started hissing and <em>spitting</em> at us! Apparently it is very rude to leave a bullfight in the middle. Ruder, it seems, than killing a bull.</p>
